Those drivers should be to blame for the road accidents caused by auto car

With the development of automatic pilot system, a great number of social problems about laws and ethics come out. There is a question among these discussed most popular, that is, who should take responsibility, or, pay for the forfeit. whatever major or secondary. Lots of answers were debated, including the drivers, automakers as well as insurance companies.

According to varies views on the Internet, the major responsibility of auto-car accidents should be in charge of those careless drivers. As far as I concerned, it is a reasonable operation to handle crisis effectively but temporarily.

For the first aspect, to be graded by different types of automatic pilot system, those drivers should take responsibility when they choose the higher level of pilot systems. The auto pilot system do not represent that a driving car could handing out any problem from such complex situations on the road.
